            <h2>Alma 32:28</h2>
            <p>Now, we will compare the word unto a seed. Now, if ye give place, that a seed may be planted in your
                heart, behold, if it be a true seed, or a good seed, if ye do not cast it out by your unbelief, that ye
                will resist the Spirit of the Lord, behold, it will begin to swell within your breasts; and when you
                feel these swelling motions, ye will begin to say within yourselves—It must needs be that this is a good
                seed, or that the word is good, for it beginneth to enlarge my soul; yea, it beginneth to enlighten my
                understanding, yea, it beginneth to be delicious to me.</p>

            <p>
                15 Yea, he that truly humbleth himself, and repenteth of his sins, and endureth to the end, the same
                shall be blessed—yea, much more blessed than they who are compelled to be humble because of their
                exceeding poverty.</p>
